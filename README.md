What I want to do...?

--------
I want to find a way to realize this paper using python.
Barbarini N, Magni P. Accurate peak list extraction from proteomic mass spectra for identification and profiling studies. BMC Bioinformatics. 2010;11:518. doi:10.1186/1471-2105-11-518.
For a LC-MS/MS raw data, with both ms1 and ms2, try to get the accurate monomer's mass of abundant molecules in each scan, so that I count the numbers of distinguish molecules in order of their abundance.
